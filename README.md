Project Overview
# The API Gateway

The API Gateway should:

- Accept HTTP requests and route them to different backend services.
- Load the routing configuration from a file (JSON or YAML).
- Implement a simple load-balancing strategy (e.g., round-robin) when multiple instances of a service are present.
